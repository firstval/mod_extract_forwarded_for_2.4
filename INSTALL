This software is distributed at no charge and in accordance with the
Apache Software Foundation's Apache license. It is subject to the lack
of warranties and indemnities, and conditions given at the begining of
the mod_extract_forwarded.c file accompanying this file. No support is
offered or available from the author of this Apache module.

mod_extract_forwarded has been developed and used in conjunction with
Apache 2.0.48 using gcc and other related GNU tools running on Solaris 9
on Sparc and Suse Linux 7.3 on x386.

With Apache installed in /usr/local/apache2 the following command serves
to build and install a DSO version of the module:

/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs -c -i -a mod_extract_forwarded.c

If the Apache instance you are adding mod_extract_forwarded to will not
have mod_proxy and proxy_http loaded then you will get an error when
mod_extract_forwarded is loaded. In that case edit
mod_extract_forwarded.c and comment out the #define for
USING_proxy_http_module or change it to an an #undef. If you
subsequently run Apache with proxy_http do not forget to reinstate the
#define; failure to do so will mean that any X-Fowarded-For header
inserted by proxy_http will use the spoofed IP number in error.
